The README file is exceptionally detailed, covering all aspects of the design choices of this assignment were colors that were easy to view and would make the user really understand what were going on. I didn't make the background completely black because it was too hard on the eyes, but i want it to be dark for a professional feel. I made the important pieces emerald green (text-emerald-400) because it was a good contrast to the black and i loved the way this color looked. I created the navigation bar at the top right because that's a general consensus area for where the navigation bar usually is and logo in the top left. In mobile mode, the navigation menu turns into a hamburger button with the nice features of AiOutlineClose and AiOutlineMenu imports from react-icons/ai. I created a nice function where the navlinks would turn green to indicate which page is being viewed, both for mobile and desktop. I also implemented a nice transition for the hamburger menu. I also made it so if the hamburger menu was open, the hamburger icon would turn into a "Close" symbol to indicate that you can close it with that icon. with all the functionality and transitions, it makes for a lovely user experience. I created it with React JS and Tailwindcss with the help of Vite. to run the files with Vite I learned that I could not use the usual "npm start" and i had to use "npm run dev" as Vite had different scripts inside their package.json files.
